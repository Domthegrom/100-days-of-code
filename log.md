# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Javascript30 challenge by wesbos, where we only use plain javascript to build simple apps and completed the first 2 days.

**Thoughts:** I try to fix the apps on my own, not only copying what's in the videos.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the day 3, 4 and 5 from the Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts:** I learned about css variables and flexbox. I have to look more deeply into flexbox, it's not so easy at first.
